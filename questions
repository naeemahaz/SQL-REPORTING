What tables do we need to pull from?
How should we combine the tables? 
what fields do we need to create?
what filters need to be included? 
Any ordering or limiting needed? 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

step 1:  What tables do we need to pull from?  --- create a diagram and highlight the relevant fields by table
step 2: How should we combine the tables?  ---  unions or joins
step 3: what fields do we need to create? --- static string, conditional and/or aggr
step 4: what filters need to be included?  --- where or having
        WHERE is used when filtering on a dimension, such as GENDER. HAVING is used when filtering on an aggregation, such as SUM 
step 5: Any ordering or limiting needed?  Order By or Limit         
        
        
Planning the SELECT statement
When setting up queries, it is important to use the correct aggregations for fields. A common mistake is to incorrectly set up a ratio. In this exercise, your goal is to create a report that shows the ratio of nobel_prize_winners and pop_in_millions.

Which of the following SELECT statements would sufficiently create this report?


SELECT AVG(nobel_prize_winners/pop_in_millions)

SELECT SUM(nobel_prize_winners)/SUM(pop_in_millions)  --- ANSWER

SELECT SUM(nobel_prize_winners/pop_in_millions)

SELECT MAX(nobel_prize_winners/pop_in_millions) - MIN(nobel_prize_winners/pop_in_millions)



Since HAVING filters after aggregations, filtering on AVG(age) would not work since it filters out entire events instead of individual athletes.
