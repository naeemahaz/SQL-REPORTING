-- Pull column_name & data_type from the columns table
SELECT 
	COLUMN_NAME,
    data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
-- Filter for the table 'country_stats'
WHERE table_name = 'country_stats';

Great! Using this approach to identify data types can help you plan for potential data type inconsistencies.



-- Run the query, then convert a data type to fix the error
SELECT AVG(CAST(pop_in_millions AS float)) AS avg_population
FROM country_stats;

/*SELECT 
	s.country_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.athlete_id) AS summer_athletes, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.athlete_id) AS winter_athletes
FROM summer_games AS s
JOIN winter_games_str AS w
ON s.country_id = w.country_id
GROUP BY s.country_id;*/


-- Comment out the previous query
---SELECT avg(CAST(pop_in_millions AS int)) AS avg_population
----FROM country_stats;

-- Uncomment the following block & run the query
SELECT 
	s.country_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT s.athlete_id) AS summer_athletes, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.athlete_id) AS winter_athletes
FROM summer_games AS s
JOIN winter_games_str AS w
-- Fix the error by making both columns integers
ON cast(s.country_id as int) = cast(w.country_id as int)
GROUP BY s.country_id;


SELECT 
	year,
    -- Pull decade, decade_truncate, and the world's gdp
    DATE_PART('decade',CAST(year AS date)) AS decade,
    DATE_TRUNC('decade',CAST(year AS date)) AS decade_truncated,
    SUM(gdp) AS world_gdp
FROM country_stats
-- Group and order by year in descending order
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year DESC;

-- Convert country to proper case
SELECT 
	country, 
    LOWER(country) AS country_altered
FROM countries
GROUP BY country;

String functions
There are a number of string functions that can be used to alter strings. A description of a few of these functions are shown below:

The LOWER(fieldName) function changes the case of all characters in fieldName to lower case.
The INITCAP(fieldName) function changes the case of all characters in fieldName to proper case.
The LEFT(fieldName,N) function returns the left N characters of the string fieldName.
The SUBSTRING(fieldName from S for N) returns N characters starting from position S of the string fieldName. Note that both from S and for N are optional.

-- Convert country to proper case
SELECT 
	country, 
    INITCAP(country) AS country_altered
FROM countries
GROUP BY country;

-- Output all characters starting with position 7
SELECT 
	country, 
    LEFT(country,3) AS country_altered
FROM countries
GROUP BY country;


-- Output all characters starting with position 7
SELECT 
	country, 
    SUBSTRING(country,7) AS country_altered
FROM countries
GROUP BY country;
